### Project Description
Clickstream analysis in online retails or physical store is one of the hot topics.  This project aims to do a customer behavior from clickstream/physical store visit.  

### Project Objectives (It can be adjusted by students) 
(1)	Use data mining models to find out how often the same customer revisiting the store (online or physical), the location and how long the customer staying in online/physical store, the customer demographics such as age and gender by using the online clickstream and transaction dataset, to find out it from transaction dataset.

(2)	Use classification model(s) and/or text analysis model(s) to classify the customers’ sentiment by using the consumer’s comments/comment scores on products in social media dataset.

(3)	Use classification model(s) to classify the customers’ shopping behaviors based on their clickstream (e.g. visit frequency, visit location and duration, web browsing/location history, purchasing items, demographics, etc.), for lead generation and marketing promotion.

(4)	Use data mining models to find out the similar customers’ shopping behaviors based on their clickstream (e.g. visit frequency, visit location and duration, web browsing/location history, purchasing items, demographics, etc.).

(5)	Use prediction model(s) and/or text analysis model(s) to predict the sales or product trend based on the consumer’s visits and comments on products in social media/transaction dataset.

(6)	Develop an integrated model to combine the above analyses into a dashboard and to provide recommendation to create customer insight analysis in Chatbot.
